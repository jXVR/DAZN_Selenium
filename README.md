Tested on macos monterey

## Have docker desktop installed

To run container locally simply exec from your terminal:

`./run_docker_container_test.sh # after this you should be inside container`

`./install.sh # when inside container. It should prepare project and print command to run all tests`

Have fun with fixing project. It seems like there are some issues with source code and webdriver configuration. I did not check/ fix everything, so there still may be problems with used docker image.
